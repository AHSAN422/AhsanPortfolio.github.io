### Data Analysis
**Cardio Data Analysis**

The objective was to study and analyze which of the products is effective in terms of fitness and usage. The project involved interpretation of statistical output to generate managerial recommendations, using regression as a prediction device and most importantly evaluating and choosing of alternative statistical models.

**Skills and Tools**

Exploratory Data Analysis ( Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis, Missing Value Treatement), R

**R Shiny App For Exploratory Data Analysis**


The objective was to build an app that helps in Exploratory Data Analysis without writing one line of code. Upload dataset in any file format like CSV/text or excel file. You can check the structure of the dataset, statistical summary, Uni-variate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis thought to the plot, user can convert strings to factor and chose a desired type of visualization. This app will collect automatically numeric columns/features and gives us the correlation among them Machine Learning algorithm Linear regression also applied on Bi-Variate visualizations.

**Skills and Tools**

R , R-Shiny, ggplot2,Linear Regression, shinydashboard,DataExplorer,networkD3
